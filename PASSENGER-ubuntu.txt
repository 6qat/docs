Open a terminal, and type:
gem install passenger
Type:
passenger-install-apache2-module
Or, if you want to install the Nginx version instead:
passenger-install-nginx-module
And follow the instructions.
Or, for the standalone version, type:

cd /path/to/your/webapp
passenger start
If you encounter any problems, please read the Users guide (Apache)/Users guide (Nginx)/Users guide (Standalone) for troubleshooting tips and/or try the tarball below.

# Configurar o Ubuntu:
curl -L http://bit.ly/nginx-ubuntu-init-file > /etc/init.d/nginx
chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
update-rc.d nginx defaults
/etc/init.d/nginx start


Nginx with Passenger support was successfully installed.

The Nginx configuration file (/home/guiga/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf)
must contain the correct configuration options in order for Phusion Passenger
to function correctly.

This installer has already modified the configuration file for you! The
following configuration snippet was inserted:

  http {
      ...
      passenger_root /home/guiga/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/passenger-3.0.7;
      passenger_ruby /home/guiga/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.2-p180/ruby;
      ...
  }

After you start Nginx, you are ready to deploy any number of Ruby on Rails
applications on Nginx.

Press ENTER to continue.

--------------------------------------------

Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example

Suppose you have a Ruby on Rails application in /somewhere. Add a server block
to your Nginx configuration file, set its root to /somewhere/public, and set
'passenger_enabled on', like this:

   server {
      listen 80;
      server_name www.yourhost.com;
      root /somewhere/public;   # <--- be sure to point to 'public'!
      passenger_enabled on;
   }

And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
optimization tips and other useful information:
